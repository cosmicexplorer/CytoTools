===========

This package is a collection of utilities to perform the analyses described in the 2019 paper *[Computational Immune Monitoring Reveals Abnormal Double-Negative T Cells Present across Human Tumor Types ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30413431/)*. High-level analysis methods in [`R/analysis.R`](R/analysis.R) have extensive documentation accessible via  `help()`; for example, see `help(CytoTools::pairwise_emd)`:

Compute Pairwise EMD Over a List of Matrices

Description:

     ‘pairwise_emd’ computes the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between
     the rows of each pair of matrices given, and writes the resultant
     distance matrix to a CSV file.

Usage:

     pairwise_emd(tsne_matrices, downsample_rows = 1000, comparison_runs = 10,
       summary_funs = list(mean = mean, variance = var),
       parallel_cores = parallel::detectCores(), verbose_timing = FALSE)

Arguments:

tsne_matrices: named list of matrices, each with the same number of
          columns. Need not have the same number of rows, but should be
          nonempty.

downsample_rows: positive integer, the number of rows to downsample
          each matrix to on each EMD comparison. If this is greater
          than the number of rows in the matrix with fewest rows in
          ‘tsne_matrices’, it will be shrunk to the number of rows of
          the smallest matrix.

comparison_runs: positive integer, the number of times to perform the
          EMD computation for each pair of matrices in ‘tsne_matrices’.

summary_funs: list of functions, each of which accept a floating-point
          vector and produce a scalar floating-point. Names will be
          reused in the output if provided.

parallel_cores: positive integer, number of cores to use for
          parallelism. Default should be optimal.

verbose_timing: logical, whether to display a message describing the
          runtime at the conclusion of each EMD calculation.

Details:

     For each pair of matrices in ‘tsne_matrices’, a floating-point
     vector is generated by downsampling both matrices to
     ‘downsample_rows’ and performing the EMD calculation on the
     downsampled matrices with ‘transport::wasserstein()’. This is
     performed ‘comparison_runs’ times per pair of matrices, producing
     a vector of length ‘comparison_runs’.

     Each function in `summary_funs` is applied to each vector of EMD
     calculations, producing a list of symmetrical distance matrices. In other
     words, each of the matrices in this list is produced by applying the
     corresponding function in `summary_funs` to the vector of EMD
     calculations for each pair of elements in `tsne_matrices`. If names are
     provided to elements of `summary_funs`, they are reused for the
     corresponding element of the output list.

     For example, if `summary_funs = list(mean = mean)`, the output list
     contains an n x n matrix of the mean of each EMD run for each pair of
     matrices in `tsne_matrices` (where `n == length(tsne_matrices)`).

Value:

     Named list of symmetric distance matrices containing the result of
     applying each of ‘summary_funs’ to each vector of
     ‘comparison_runs’ EMD calculations for each pair of matrices in
     the input. Each matrix's row and column names are set to the names
     of ‘tsne_matrices’.

     The output list also contains the keys `downsample_rows` and
     `comparison_runs` (in that order, at the start of the output list),
     containing the values provided to these arguments when this function was
     called. If names are provided to elements of `summary_funs`, they are
     reused for the corresponding element of the output list.

See Also:

     ‘transport::wasserstein()’ for the underlying EMD implementation.
     ‘gplots::heatmap.2()’ can be used to plot heatmaps of the distance
     matrices computed.

Examples:

     ## create example matrices (need not have same number of rows)
     a <- matrix(runif(100, 0, 1), ncol = 2)
     b <- matrix(runif(100, 0, 1), ncol = 2)
     c <- matrix(runif(100, 0, 1), ncol = 2)
     ## calc pairwise EMD 15 times and get mean, median, and sample variance of
     ## the 15 calculations per pair, downsampling to 45 rows each time
     result <- pairwise_emd(
         list("matrix A" = a,
              "matrix B" = b,
              "matrix C" = c),
         downsample_rows = 45,
         comparison_runs = 15,
         summary_funs = list("mean" = mean,
                             "median" = median,
                             "variance" = var))

# Installation

For now, `devtools::install_github("cosmicexplorer/cytotools")`.
- If `flowCore` is unavailable for your version of R, you may need to also install it from github (at https://github.com/RGLab/flowCore) with `devtools::install_github("RGLab/flowCore")`.
- The `comparisort` dependency (at https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/comparisort) is not published on CRAN, so you may need to also `devtools::install_github("cosmicexplorer/comparisort")`.
